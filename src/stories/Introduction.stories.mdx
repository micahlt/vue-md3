The `vue-md3` package provides Vue 3 components based (somewhat loosely) on the [Material You](https://m3.material.io/) design system. It is in _very_ early development, and you should not use it in production until it hits the 1.0 release.

## To-Do List

This project isn't near done. Here's everything we're working on.

### `Button`

- ✅ Create component
- ⚒️ Standardize sizing on `outline` type
- ⚒️ Add hover state to `secondary` type
- ⚒️ Document the `mode` attribute

### `Card`

- ✅ Create component
- ⚒️ Replace most props with a `<slot>` for flexibility
- ⚒️ Add more intelligent header image recognition

### `Chip`

- ✅ Create component
- ✅ Handle icon and no-icon versions
- ⚒️ Remove the shadows to follow Material Guidelines

### Components to be added

Below are the components that have been built, but need to be significantly edited before being added to `vue-md3`

- `Dialog`
  - Currently doesn't follow Material Guidelines at all, should be rewritten
- `NavBar`
  - This component takes the place of both the navigation bar and navigation rail
- `Select`
  - This isn't an official Material component
- `Switch`
  - Scaling feels off - should be smaller

### Theming issues

All components are based on CSS variables that switch to dark mode. We need to add some sort of toggle that will allow Storybook to switch in-between both themes. We should also really switch our custom variables to schemes exported from the [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/#/custom).
